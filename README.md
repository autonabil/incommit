# Getting Involved
If you are a developer, you can start by making a forking and making a pull request, please be precise in your description of what changes you have made. It should be something like: Changed the typo of word "fuunt" to "funny" in index.html and not: Changed typo. I will run extensive checks on the pull request and finally merge it.

# Submitting an issue
If you have seen a bug in this app or any other, please be specific when submitting an issue. Your body should contain the problem, how to reproduce the problems and suggestions (if any).

# Using it for an organization (or personal use)
I am more than happy that you are using my repo and work, but please do note for the works or projects that have license on it and abide the license accordingly, Even though the project has or doesnt have a icense, I personally require you to give credit where it is supposed to be given, You can add it to anywhere on your page but it SHOULD NOT be to the extent where the website visitors have to look for my link. i.e. It should be displayed somewhere that is obvious. Unless I personally have license you to use this repo without credits, I will still need you to credit me by placing BOTH my Github profile link and also the repository link. Under circumstances where my username or the repository name has been changed, I urge the user to quickly replace the links.

# Obtaining a license
You can obtain a license by personally emailing me at nabilrdhwn@gmail.com . I will try my best to reply to your email. By obtaining the license you have the ability or has access to:
- Not give credits (in a webpage)

But you do not have the ability to:
- Claim the work or project to be yours unless we have made a mutual agreement.

However, I would personally recommend you not to obtain a license from me as it is more easier to just give credits.

# Violating the license or personal agreement
If you were to violate the license, it would have been a legal issue but if you violate the personal agreement (which is the long paragraph on top), this will be a serious issue because that counts as a copyright ingfringement and will be dealt with case by case.
