I am more than happy that you are using my repo and work, but please do not for the works or projects that have license on it, I personally require you to give credit where it is supposed to be given, You can add it to anywhere on your page but it SHOULD NOT be hidden. Unless I personally have license you to use this repo without credits, I will still need you to credit me by placing BOTH my Github profile link and also the repository link. Under circumstances where my username or the repository name has been changed, I urge the user to quickly replace the links.
